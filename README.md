Conway's Game of Life
=====================

This is a very simple implementation of Conway's game of life.

## Running

Install the required libraries with `pip intall -r requirements.txt`

Run with `python main.py`

Run a scenario with `python main.py path/to/scenario.bmp`

Yeah, its kinda broken, but i'm having fun :)
